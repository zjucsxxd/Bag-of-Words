============

Image Classification using BoW

This is a programming assignment to implement and test a “bag of features” method for object recognition. The described method is a simpler version of the method described in the paper by Csurka et al and discussed in class.
You are given a set of 20 training images each for five object categories (car, cougar, face, pizza, and sunflower) and 10 test images of each category. Your task is to implement a classifier using bag of features approach and test it on the given images. The training images and test images are in .jpg format and can be downloaded from the class website.
